                <p>
                    I have over 5 years of experience in software development, focusing on building robust and scalable
                    solutions that drive value across various industries. My expertise lies in designing and maintaining
                    high-load distributed systems, where performance, reliability, and fault tolerance are essential
                    under intense workloads. I emphasize creating architectures that are not only scalable and flexible
                    but also easy to support and evolve over time. I always strive to deliver high-quality results that
                    align with both user expectations and business goals.

                    Throughout my career, I’ve worked in large technology companies known for their rigorous standards,
                    which helped me develop a strategic mindset and the ability to craft long-lasting, efficient
                    solutions. In addition to back-end development, I have hands-on experience in front-end
                    technologies, allowing me to approach projects from a full-stack perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thrive in team environments, adapt quickly to new settings, and am committed to mastering tools
                    and technologies to achieve the best possible outcomes. When entrusted with a task, I take full
                    ownership and ensure timely delivery with high efficiency and quality, regardless of the project’s
                    scope or audience.
